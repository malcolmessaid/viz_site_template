    "# Visualizing User-Input Functions\n",
    "##### By Malcolm Essaid\n",
    "1. The goal of my project is to allow  the user to plug in simple functions and for them to be able to see the graph on a cartesien plane of domain [-10,10] and range [-10,10]. My program will hopefully have similar functionality to desmos. I am interested in the porject, because it seems like an interesting problem, and I wanted to see if I could figure it out. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. I won't need to collect any data from outside sources because each time the user plugs in a function, I'll create a new dataset from that function. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. This Juypter notebook won't have any code becuase I don't need any external datasets"
